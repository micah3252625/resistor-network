# Resistance Calculator Application

## Project Overview

The **Resistance Calculator** is a Python application that allows users to calculate the total resistance for resistors connected in **series** or **parallel**. The program uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter to facilitate user interaction.

Users can:
- Add resistor values to the list.
- View the total resistance in either a **series** or **parallel** configuration.
- Clear all resistors and reset the calculation.

### Features:
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes encapsulate resistors and resistor networks.
- **GUI**: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
- **Series and Parallel Resistance Calculations**: The app supports calculations for both configurations.
- **Resistor List Display**: A live list of added resistors is shown in the GUI.
